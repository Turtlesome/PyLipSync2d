# PyLipSync2d

My attempt of making automated lipsync in Toon Boom Harmony. Better than default version in TB yet still very unstable. 
Lipsync is based on onsets provided by librosa library.
It produces the textfile where each line is a number for a corresponding sound in english the character made.
